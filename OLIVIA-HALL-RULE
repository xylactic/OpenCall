If you're a fascist, you shouldn't use this software. While I believe in libre software, and therefore this is licensed under GPL-3 and you can do whatever you want, I strongly discourage any fascists from using this software. If you're reading this and thinking, "You just call everyone you disagree with a fascist," then you're probably a fascist, or incapable of drawing inferences from context and acknowledging a dangerous political climate that causes the oppressed to be hyperbolic. Don't play this game. Heal yourself. Grow. Learn. Watch some Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood or something.
